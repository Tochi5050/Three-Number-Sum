Question:
Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and
an integer representing a target sum. The function should find
all triplets in the array that sum up to the target sum and return 
a two-dimensional array of all these triplets. The numbers in each
triplet should be ordered in ascending order, and the triplets themselves
should be ordered in ascending order with respect to the numbers
they hold. If no three numbers sum up to the target sum, the function
should return an empty array.

Sample Input
array = [12, 3, 1, 2, -6, 5. -8, 6]

targetSum = 0

Sample Output
[[-8,2,6], [-8,3,5], [-6,1,5]]

Thought Process:

Brute Force:-  This method involves looping through the array
three times, with indices i,j,k. The time complexity would then
be o(n^3), which wont be optimal

Three pointers: This involves placing three pointers at the
beginning, at the next index to the beginning index and one at the
last index, adding these values and finding the closest and
farthest from the target sum, the pointers are moved either to the right 
or to the left, while the initial array is sorted.
For this solution, time complexity and space complexity evaluate to
Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(n)
